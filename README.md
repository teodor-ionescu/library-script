# library-script

A basic web app which helps you register books with their author and an unique number into a MySQL database, and then search for them. It also helps you to keep logs of people you have rented certain books. All coded in vanilla PHP.

The app is unusable now without an installer. DB tables must be created and populated manually. I will add an automated installer in the next version. :-)
